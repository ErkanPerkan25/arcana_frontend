## The Process

As I read a lot of books of litterature and philsophy, I like to keep track of 
my thought and ideas I find when reading. I have used both note programs Notion 
and Obsidian. Both are great programs, but they still couldn't fully satisfy 
the way I wanted to keep my notes organized to books. So, I used `React.js` with
`Tailwind CSS` to create a web application with simple design that keeps my notes
organized in a simple mannger.
